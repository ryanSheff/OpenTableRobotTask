# OpenTableRobotTask
My coding test for OpenTable to make a program able to move a robot around an arena of a provided size

All instructions should be clear on the command line, as should all issues with information entered. Lines are to be entered 1 at a time instead of 1 input, designed to look better and be more intuitive than a full line of all inputs.

This project is scalable for more robots, as well as the option to change around the input order to make a game out of it (Set each robot's starting position at the start, and then have the instructions be input 1 at a time, for turn based strategy and movement). Would also like to implement an attack system, with health points for each robot, which can be achieved since Robot is it's own class and I could add that variable quite easily.
